An End-to-End Data Initiative by Data and ML Team of GDG On Campus PUP


## Project Overview

Project DREAMS (DataCamp Resources & Engagement Analytics Monitoring System) aims to provide a comprehensive analytics platform for GDG On Campus PUP's DataCamp scholars. By developing an end-to-end data solution, we can track progress metrics, visualize patterns, and ultimately improve resource allocation and workshop planning. This project also serves as a reusable framework for other DataCamp Partners.

## Background

The current DataCamp administrative dashboard lacks the necessary tools to effectively track and analyze the performance metrics of cadets, external scholars, and PUP students. This limitation hinders our ability to extract meaningful insights that could optimize workshop planning and activity development.

## Project Objectives

1.  **Design and implement comprehensive performance metrics and interactive visualizations** to enhance the monitoring capabilities of the system.
2.  **Develop a web-based analytics platform** specifically specially made to track DataCamp scholars' progress under GDG PUP supervision.

## Project Impact

This initiative provides practical learning opportunities for Data and Machine Learning associates, enabling them to:

* Build end-to-end data solutions using real DataCamp learning metrics.
* Strengthen members' technical skills through collaborative development using Git, GitHub, and Google Colab.
* Master essential data tools: Pandas for analysis, Plotly for visualization, and Streamlit for deployment.
