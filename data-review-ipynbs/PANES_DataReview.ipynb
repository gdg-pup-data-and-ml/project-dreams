By identifying which completed courses contribute to certification success, scholars can follow structured learning paths that enhance their chances of passing. Understanding learning activity patterns will help recommend the best study times, making learning more productive. Detecting where and why scholars drop out of courses will allow for improvements in course design and engagement strategies, ensuring higher retention. Analyzing engagement with different topics will help refine content delivery, making learning more effective and motivating. Lastly, identifying the most popular and completed tracks will guide scholars toward valuable learning paths that align with their interests and career goals. These insights will create a more personalized, engaging, and efficient learning environment, leading to better success rates and overall learning outcomes."
