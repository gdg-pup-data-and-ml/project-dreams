        "# Introduction\n",
        "This research examines how Datacamp scholars engage with courses, assessments, and projects to identify factors contributing to learning progress. We analyze the connection between time spent on courses, completion rates, and assessment results to determine what drives higher performance. Additionally, we assess how scholars' course choices align with their intended tracks and technology focus, measuring the impact on engagement, time spent on progress, and XP accumulation. By utilizing these learning patterns and their performance and participation data, this study seeks to enhance personalized track recommendations and improve support through our study jams, workshops, and guided learning paths.\n",
