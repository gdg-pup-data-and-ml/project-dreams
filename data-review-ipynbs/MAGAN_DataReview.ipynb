    "DataCamp is a popular online learning platform that allows students to study machine learning and data science. Although well-known, it lacks the ability to display student progress visually, making it difficult for administrators to track **improvements through various metrics** and **visualize patterns and trends**. Implementing a system to do so would enable the administrators to improve resource allocation and workshop planning.\n",

    "- Use statistical methods and machine learning to **differentiate top performers from others**, uncover trends, and predict outcomes\n",
    "- Of course **gather the right data** from the databank with security and all\n",
    "- **Integrate the effective and scientific study techniques** to datacamp after the analysis (_are they doing spaced repetition, projects every after courses?_ \\[techniques that are based and scientific])\n",

Lastly, I want to know how our students doing not just inside the datacamp but also in their lives for I believe these things affect how people learn and simple check-ups can help the student get pass their struggles when studying data tech."
