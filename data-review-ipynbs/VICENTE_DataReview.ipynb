        "DataCamp's [Data Model](https://enterprise-docs.datacamp.com/data-connector/explore-data-model/data-model) offers a vast amount of enterprise user data that can be further utilized for reliable and accurate data analytics. As it stands, several metrics like the user XP fail to provide an accurate measurement of user performance due to external factors like exploits. Apart from that, a few metrics such as the course difficulty are missing from the data model, making it difficult to keep track of the user's skill level. Despite its shortcomings, a lot of useful data still remains to be analyzed for insights on user engagement. Through feature engineering with proper mathematical references, data analytics, and machine learning models, a plethora of meaningful insights can be derived from the existing dataset. By delving into several aspects that would prove to be useful in achieving the goals of **Project DREAMS**, this document addresses potential improvements in scholar management such as planning, monitoring, and resource allocation.\n",

Additionally, these `difficulty` values are set by the instructor and it does not reflect user experience, making it arbitrary. Due to the lack of having a reliable difficulty metric, the group would not be able to properly measure a course's true difficulty, as well as make accurate course recommendations to cater to different skill levels. Having access to a reliable difficulty metric allows the group to make appropriate recommendations to beginners and experienced scholars alike. With data transformation, a proper difficulty metric can be made by utilizing the statistics of time spent on a particular course.\n",

Proposals under the **Learning Analytics** category makes use of feature engineering backed with sound mathematical concepts to provide a more grounded, secure, and accurate metric for monitoring scholar performance. On the other hand, **Engagement Trends** aims to provide insights regarding scholar study patterns and engagement rate to serve as a basis for workshop and intervention planning. The **Retention Prediction** category utilizes a machine learning model to study the behaviors and statistics of dropped scholars in order to predict and prevent those who are at-risk of dropping. Lastly, the **Honesty & Fair Play** category addresses the XP exploitation issue, how it affects scholars, how a predictive model could help solve the issue, and how preventing XP exploitation would benefit not only the community, but also those who exploit XP themselves. All categories and proposals within contribute to the ultimate goal of **Project DREAMS**: improving the scholar's learning experience by improving scholar management.\n"
