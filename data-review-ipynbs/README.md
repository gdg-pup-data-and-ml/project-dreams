## Introduction

Welcome to the `data-review-ipynbs` folder of **Project DREAMS: DataCamp Resources & Engagement Analytics Monitoring System**! This folder is where contributors will submit their Google Colab notebooks containing the 5 research questions and analyses as outlined in the **Project DREAMS: Data Analysis Assignment**. The dataset for this assignment is sourced from the DataCamp Data Connector (see shield above for documentation). This README provides step-by-step instructions to help you submit your work, even if you're new to Git and GitHub.

### Important Note on Repository Access and Branch Permissions
As a member of the GDG On Campus PUP organization, you do not automatically have access or permission to commit to this repository. Access depends on:
- **Organization base permissions**: Check if the organization grants "Write" access to all members.
- **Repository-specific permissions**: You must be explicitly granted "Write" or higher access to this repository, either individually or through a team.
- **Team membership**: If you're part of a team with access to this repository, your permissions align with the team's settings.

**Branch Restrictions**:
- Contributors are **only allowed to push changes to the `data-review` branch**.
- Direct pushes to the `main` branch are **not permitted**. All changes to `main` must be submitted via pull requests (PRs) and approved by maintainers.
- Branch protection rules are enforced to ensure this workflow. If you attempt to push to `main`, you will receive an error.

If you cannot commit or push to the `data-review` branch, contact the project lead (John Paul Curada) or an organization owner to verify your permissions. For more details, refer to GitHub's documentation on [organization permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories).

## Assignment Overview

Your task is to:
1. Review the [DataCamp Data Connector documentation](https://enterprise-docs.datacamp.com/data-connector/explore-data-model/data-model).
2. Formulate **5 research questions** that provide valuable insights for tracking and improving DataCamp scholar engagement.
3. For each question:
   - Explain its relevance to Project DREAMS objectives.
   - Identify the tables and columns needed to answer the question.
   - Describe any joins, aggregations, or calculations required.
   - Explain how the insights could improve scholar management.

## Submission Guidelines

Follow these steps to submit your work to the `data-review-ipynbs` folder. Ensure you adhere to the file naming, formatting, and commit message conventions. **All submissions must be pushed to the `data-review` branch, not `main`.**

### 1. Prepare Your Google Colab Notebook
- Create a Google Colab notebook for your assignment.
- Use the filename format: `SURNAME_DataReview.ipynb` (e.g., `CURADA_DataReview.ipynb`).
- Structure your notebook with the following sections using Markdown cells:
  - **Introduction**: Brief overview of your approach.
  - **Research Questions**: Your 5 research questions, each including:
    - The question itself.
    - Relevance to Project DREAMS objectives.
    - Tables and columns required from the DataCamp Data Connector.
    - Methodology (joins, aggregations, calculations).
    - Potential insights and actions.
  - **Conclusion**: Summarize how your insights would benefit Project DREAMS.
- Ensure your notebook uses proper Markdown formatting for readability.

### 2. Download Your Notebook
- Download your Google Colab notebook as an `.ipynb` file:
  - Go to `File > Download > Download .ipynb`.
  - Save the file with the correct filename (e.g., `SURNAME_DataReview.ipynb`).

### 3. Check Your Repository Setup
- **If you have already forked and cloned the repository** (i.e., you completed these steps for a previous submission):
  - Skip to **Step 4 (Update Your Local Repository)**.
- **If you have NOT previously forked and cloned the repository**:
  - Follow **Steps 4-6** to set up your repository, then proceed to **Step 7**.

### 4. Fork the Repository (First-Time Setup Only)
- Go to the main repository page on GitHub.
- Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner to create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.
- This fork will allow you to make changes and submit pull requests.

### 5. Clone the Repository (First-Time Setup Only)
- Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone <your-forked-repo-url>
  ```
  - Replace `<your-forked-repo-url>` with the URL of your forked repository (found on GitHub under "Code").
- Navigate to the repository folder:
  ```bash
  cd <repository-name>
  ```

### 6. Set Up the Upstream Remote (First-Time Setup Only)
- Add the original repository as an upstream remote to keep your fork updated:
  ```bash
  git remote add upstream <original-repo-url>
  ```
  - Replace `<original-repo-url>` with the URL of the main repository (e.g., `https://github.com/<org-name>/<repo-name>.git`).

### 7. Update Your Local Repository (For Returning Contributors)
- If you already have the repository cloned, ensure your local copy is up-to-date with the main repository:
  ```bash
  git fetch upstream
  git checkout main
  git merge upstream/main
  ```
- Push the updates to your fork:
  ```bash
  git push origin main
  ```

### 8. Switch to the `data-review` Branch
- Switch to the `data-review` branch in your local repository:
  ```bash
  git checkout data-review
  ```
- If the `data-review` branch does not exist locally, pull it from the upstream repository:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b data-review
  git pull upstream data-review
  ```

### 9. Add Your Notebook to the Repository
- Copy your downloaded `.ipynb` file (e.g., `SURNAME_DataReview.ipynb`) into the `data-review-ipynbs` folder in your local repository.
- Stage the file for commit:
  ```bash
  git add data-review-ipynbs/SURNAME_DataReview.ipynb
  ```

### 10. Commit Your Changes
- Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Add data review notebook for <Your Surname>"
  ```
  - Example: `git commit -m "Add data review notebook for Curada"`.

### 11. Push Your Changes to the `data-review` Branch
- Push your changes to the `data-review` branch in your forked repository:
  ```bash
  git push origin data-review
  ```
- **Note**: You cannot push directly to the `main` branch due to branch protection rules. If you attempt to push to `main`, you will receive an error.

### 12. Create a Pull Request (PR)
- Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
- You should see a banner indicating that you recently pushed to the `data-review` branch.
- Click **Compare & pull request**.
- In the pull request:
  - Use the title: `Data Review Submission - <Your Surname>` (e.g., `Data Review Submission - Curada`).
  - Add a description:
    ```
    - Submitted data review notebook: <SURNAME_DataReview.ipynb>
    - Contains 5 research questions and analyses for Project DREAMS.
    - Ready for review.
    ```
- Ensure the PR is targeting the `main` branch of the original repository.
- Submit the pull request.

## Due Date
- **Submission Deadline**: March 14, 2025.
- Be prepared to discuss your research questions in the next team meeting.

---

## Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated based on:
- Relevance to Project DREAMS objectives.
- Clarity and specificity of research questions.
- Appropriate identification of data tables and columns.
- Creativity and insight in proposed analyses.
- Actionability of potential insights.
- Proper use of Markdown formatting in the notebook.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Cannot push to `data-review` branch**: Verify your permissions with the project lead or organization owner.
- **Cannot push to `main` branch**: This is expected due to branch protection rules. Ensure you are pushing to the `data-review` branch.
- **Merge conflicts**: If your PR has conflicts, resolve them locally by pulling the latest changes from `upstream/main`, merging them into your `data-review` branch, and pushing the updated branch.
- **Need help with Git/GitHub**: Reach out to the project lead or refer to GitHub's documentation.
